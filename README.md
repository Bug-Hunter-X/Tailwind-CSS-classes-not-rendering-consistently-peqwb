This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not applied consistently across different components in a project.  The `bug.html` file shows the erroneous behavior, while `bugSolution.html` provides a solution for fixing the issue.  The likely cause is an issue with the Tailwind CSS configuration or the way the classes are being applied.
