The issue was resolved by ensuring the Tailwind CSS directives were correctly included in the project's main CSS file,  and that the `tailwind.config.js` file correctly pointed to the necessary files.  The `purge` option in `tailwind.config.js` needed to be updated to include the correct paths to the template files containing Tailwind CSS classes.

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  purge: ['./src/**/*.html', './src/**/*.js'],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Adding missing components to the `purge` array solved the styling problems.  The corrected HTML is shown below:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Tailwind CSS Bug</title>
<link href="../dist/output.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This text should have a gray background, padding, rounded corners, and a shadow.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```
