The following Tailwind CSS classes are not applied correctly in my project:

```html
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This text should have a gray background, padding, rounded corners, and a shadow.</p>
</div>
```

However, the styles are not applied as expected. The div element appears without the specified background color, padding, rounded corners, or shadow.
